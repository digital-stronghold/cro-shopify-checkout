# Shopify Plus Checkout CRO

Files included here cover the following optimizations:

1. Progress Bar
2. "Why Us?" Section
3. Payment Icons

All rely on a Liquid "step checker" snippet (a little hacky but stable until such time as Shopify next update the checkout, which they don't do without plenty of forewarning/testing time.)

## Notes

The following build processes are not included here yet:

* SCSS — Styles are minimal, could be inlined
* SVG Icons — as above
